DOING {{{

+ reimplement taskstack using traitor

@high {{{
- create doc dir with help files
-  parameterize all "magic" values
-  document all customization options
-  establish naming conventions: Dict of functions is called a `set of traits`, named `module#feature_traits` or `FeatureTraits` individual functions are just functions.

}}}
@medium {{{
- update README with documentation from .vim files
- more gracefully handle non-function values for existing keys
  - consider each type()
- project: clean up factory.apply implementation
- refactor factory.apply into more granular bits
-  allow traits to set properties as well as functions (force overwrite, if missing, error)
- register when a set of traits is applied; use this to prevent reapplication of traits

}}}
@low {{{
-  establish "reserved" names that cannot be overridden; these could silently fail or make noise.
